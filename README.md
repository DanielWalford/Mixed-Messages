# Mixed-Messages
This is a group project which forms part of the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Course.

## Goal of this Project 
Randomly create a Message and display it to the console each time the program is run. This collaboration with Kevin Koetz. 

## Message Topics and example outputs
To support a wider variety of messages and get some extra coding practice we decided to go with two Topics:
- Nonsensical Jokes
  For example: "The *cat* is *running around* and *made a mess* in *the kitchen*"
- Fortune Teller
  For example: "*In 5 days* you will *meet* *your future husband*.

  In the Examples the marked words will be swapped out against different verbs or nouns.

  ## Implementation
  1. Program should decide if it gives out a Nonsensical Joke or a Fortune Message.
  2. Have an random Index Generator which picks out a random noun or verb from prebuilt arrays.
  3. Assemble the Message and print it to the console.

### Languages and tools used
1. Node 
2. JavaScript
3. Git and Github
4. Command line
